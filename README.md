intelligent book management system
# Problem Statement:
    You are tasked with creating an intelligent book management system using Python, a locally running Llama3 generative AI model, and cloud infrastructure. The system should allow users to add, retrieve, update, and delete books from a PostgreSQL database, generate summaries for books using the Llama3 model, and provide book recommendations based on user preferences. Additionally, the system should manage user reviews and generate rating and review summaries for books. The system should be accessible via a RESTful API and deployed on cloud.
